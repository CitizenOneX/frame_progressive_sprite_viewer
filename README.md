# Frame Progressive Sprite Viewer

Basic image and sprite viewer for Brilliant Labs Frame.

Demonstrates `TxImageSpriteBlock` that splits the image into slices and sends smaller sprite lines, optionally allowing for progressive/incremental rendering and potentially a smaller peak memory requirement during packet assembly.

## Instructions

* Connect to Frame and start the application. Using the file picker, choose a 1-bit, 2-bit or 4-bit indexed (palette) PNG file from your device. Sample sprites of each type are included in the assets/ directory, which you can download to your device.
* Ensure uncompressed size (width * height * bits-per-pixel / 8) is less than about 25kB.
* Behaviour for large images and non-indexed palette PNG files is undefined. (No scaling or quantization is attempted.)
* Images should use the [Frame default palette](assets/palette-frame.aseprite) to be displayed with correct colors (Frame palette is not modified.)
* Tools such as [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/) are useful for creating 1-, 2- and 4-bit images in the required palettes.
